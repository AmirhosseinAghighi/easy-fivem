ensure all opened folders resource (resource folder should be opened) with rcon

## Features

auto connect and manual connect to fivem server (auto connect will connect to local host without asking for ip:port)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## How it works

put "rcon_password [password]" in your fivem server server.cfg file

use "fivem connect" command to connect to the localhost server with 30120 port (it will ask for password)

use "fivem custom connect" command to connect tothe custom ip and port (it will ask for ip and port and password)

use "fivem disconnect" command to disconnect from any server that previously connected
